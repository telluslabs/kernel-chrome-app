 > ### Update on Google's Chrome App Support
 >
 > Since [Google's decision to retire Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, & Linux users](http://bit.ly/GCB-Retiring-Chrome-Apps), the Kernel Chrome App will now only be available to Chromebook users.  Subsequently, this project has transitioned towards a more passive management state.  In other words, we will continue to monitor this project for feature requests and bugs/errors, however the majority of our time will now be spent actively developing the [core Kernel web platform](http://bit.ly/Kernel-TL).
 >
 > To be clear: **The [Kernel web platform](http://bit.ly/Kernel-TL) will always be under active development, and we continue to release new features & stability improvements at our normal weekly cadence**.  All new features & improvements to the core Kernel web platform flow directly into the Kernel Chrome App as well, so no matter which version of Kernel you're using, you'll always have the latest & greatest product we have to offer.
 >
 > In summary:
 >
 > * You may continue to use the Kernel Chrome app on Chromebook devices for as long as you like
 >   * You may continue to use the core Kernel web platform on any device or operating system with a modern browser
 > * While the Kernel Chrome App will continue to function as normal, we will no longer be developing any new ***chromebook-specific*** features for the Kernel Chrome App
 >
 > We hope you'll continue to submit feature requests & bug reports, and we'll be watching this repository to make sure that we're available to respond to any questions.

 > For all other inquiries, feel free to chat with us live using the in-product chat tool, or reach out to us by email via kernel-support@telluslabs.com.  As always, we'd love to hear from you!
